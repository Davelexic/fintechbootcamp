* *What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)*
  * Coinbase has the first mover advantage in which they were the first truly accepted exchange that was trusted and safe for the average user. They are known to approach the ecosystem slowly so that any addition has been thoroughly fetted for the customer. In addition, as I am writing this Coinbase will be the first crypto exchange that will be listed on the NASDAQ as a public traded company.

## Landscape:

* **What domain of the financial industry is the company in?**
      * Coinbase was originally set up to be the primary exchange for the trading and storage of cryptocurrencies. They built a platform on safety and working together with regulatory bodies to help people understand and trade with out fear of reprisal or fraud. The have since moved into other domains in the economy of cryptocurrencies. They have added multiple channels that address payment and lending with the addition of the Coinbase credit card that gives the user the ability to spend bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on daily transactions without having the use the exchange first. 
* **What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?**
      * Blockchain as a whole has been rapidly evolving as a technology year over year. Bitcoin was the first and it set its place as a digital currency and as a store of value akin to Gold. As time went on we have seen this sector move into every facet of daily life with the introduction of smart contracts through the ethereum blockchain. With the use of smart contracts you now have something of programable money that allows you to do so much more than just buy and sell. The largest market now is the DE-FI platform. De-Fi stands for decentralized finance and it allows people to use fiance tools without a major bank and relies on peers in the network. With De-Fi you can trade, lend, borrow, and even set up asset management without any middlemen. This reduces the costs to use such tools and lowers the barrier of entry for loans. The near future will bring an expansion on these principles and well as the growth of the something called NFTs. NFTs are non fungible tokens that are unique and unrepeatable. NFTs right now are being used for the sale of digital art and music but will soon move into may aspects of our live. With Nfts that sale of goods can be track so the originator is never left out of the sale again. For example, when you buy a textbook, the company has to make its profit on the first sale of the book resulting in huge markups. With the use of NFTs the sale can be tracked from person to person so the company now can make money on every addition sale in the used book marketplace. The initial sale price can come down because the company can now rely on the revenue of the additional sales. Other use cases could be the use of smart contracts in the payment of royalties to actors. The tracking and payment of actors in tv and movies is extremely hard but with the use of smart contracts everyone that is allotted a payment will receive there royalties automatically even if the payment might be to an extra that makes 10 cents per use of the media. 
* **What are the other major companies in this domain?**
     * This domain has been rapidly expanding but there are few reputable exchanges right now that are centralized.
        * Gemini Exchange
        * Binance
        * Kraken 
        * Bitpay

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
  * Coinbase is the most used exchange in America and with the recent IPO the attention will only bring more people to the exchange if compared to the second most used exchange Gemini located in New York. Gemini had a quarterly revenue of 128 Million in trading fees.Overseas the most heavily used platform would be Binance that was founded in Shanghai China but move to Taiwan over legal issues in China. Estimates on users was hard to find but in 2019, Binance estimates about 15 million people had registered on the site. In addition to users, estimates from the company say that revenue will for 2021 will be in the vicinity of 1 Billion dollars.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
  * Coinbase is slow to move to market with new features out of safety and making sure that everything functions properly before implementation. Coinbase just offered ETH2 staking as well as staking for other coins that will give users about a averaged 6% APY return on their staked token. Moving forward from this their competition, Binance, has started offering synthetic assets that track the traditional market. This will allow users to trading common stocks or an unlimited amount of other derivatives. As of right now Binance offers sTSLA and sCOIN but the these markets will grow quickly. Coinbase also needed to invest in a platform to had users and seller with NFTs. Coinbase has the backend software to do this with the service of Easy Digital Downloads and this would give users another option out side of trading tokens to invest in the ecosystem by allowing the sale of Digital assets, music, and others.
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
  * The offering of synthetic assets will help them stay competitive with other exchanges and offer a wide array of assets to hedge and diversify with outside of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The addition of NFT support for buyers and sellers will add security and safety to the trading as well as giving its users another market to buy from.
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
  * To give its users access to derivatives would be rather easy, they would just need to set a token to track decided a pon assets such as stocks or commodities. They could also reach out to Synthetix as company that is building the technology and platform to trade in synthetic stocks already. NFT's are a bit more compilated in the trading of these assets but they would reach out to Immutible X, a company that has but a platform for trading digital assets or Rariable and another well known company that has enabled its users to traded NFT's on their platform.
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
  * Sythetix has been around awhile and has been thoroughly tested. Though the technology is new to allow trading of synthetic assets the project has a wide variety of members that are actively working and improving on the framework. They have added multiple ETF trackers, commodities, and common stocks to their platform and add new assets daily.
