## Landscape:

* **What domain of the financial industry is the company in?**
      * Coinbase was originally set up to be the primary exchange for the trading and storage of cryptocurrencies. That built a platform on safety and working together with regulatory bodies to help people understand and trade with out fear of reprisal or fraud. The have since moved into other domains in the economy of cryptocurrencies. They have added multiple channels that address payment and lending with the addition of the Coinbase credit card that gives the user the ability to spend bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on daily transactions without having the use the exchange first. 
* **What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?**
      * Blockchain as a whole has been rapidly evolving as a technology year over year. Bitcoin was the first and it set its place as a digital currency and as a store of value akin to Gold. As time went on we have seen this sector move into every facet of daily life with the introduction of smart contracts through the ethereum blockchain. With the use of smart contracts you now have something of programable money that allows you to do so much more than just buy and sell. The largest market now is the DE-FI platform. De-Fi stands for decentralized finance and it allows people to use fiance tools without a major bank and relies on peers in the network. With De-Fi you can trade, lend, borrow, and even set up asset management without any middlemen. This reduces the costs to use such tools and lowers the barrier of entry for loans. The near future will bring an expansion on these principles and well as the growth of the something called NFTs. NFTs are non fungible tokens that are unique and unrepeatable. NFTs right now are being used for the sale of digital art and music but will soon move into may aspects of our live. With Nfts that sale of goods can be track so the originator is never left out of the sale again. For example, when you buy a textbook, the company has to make its profit on the first sale of the book resulting in huge markups. With the use of NFTs the sale can be tracked from person to person so the company now can make money on every addition sale in the used book marketplace. The initial sale price can come down because the company can now rely on the revenue of the additional sales. Other use cases could be the use of smart contracts in the payment of royalties to actors. The tracking and payment of actors in tv and movies is extremely hard but with the use of smart contracts everyone that is allotted a payment will receive there royalties automatically even if the payment might be to a extra that makes 10 cents per use of the media. 
* **What are the other major companies in this domain?**
     * This domain has been rapidly expanding but there are few reputable exchanges right now that are centralized.
        * Gemini Exchange
        * Binance
        * Kraken 
        * Bitpay
